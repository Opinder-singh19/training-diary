CSS OUTLINE 

WHAT IS CSS OUTLINE 
The CSS outline is a line drawn around an element, outside its border, to make it stand out. It is often used to highlight elements when they are selected or focused. 
Unlike borders, outlines do not take up space.

Difference Between Border and Outline
| **Border**                     | **Outline**                        |
| ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Inside the element             | Outside the element                |
| Takes space and affects layout | Does not take space                |
| Can set different sides        | Same on all sides                  |
| Can be rounded                 | Cannot be rounded                  |
| Used for design                | Used for highlighting (like focus) |

Text Vertical Alignment in CSS
Vertical alignment in CSS means aligning text vertically within its container or relative to other elements.

vertical-align:
| Value      | Description                               |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `top`      | Aligns text to the top                    |
| `middle`   | Aligns text to the middle                 |
| `bottom`   | Aligns text to the bottom                 |
| `baseline` | Aligns text to the baseline of the parent |
| `sub`      | Aligns as subscript                       |
| `super`    | Aligns as superscript                     |


box-sizing: border-box:
box-sizing: border-box means the total size of the element includes content, padding, and border.

So if you set width: 200px, that includes the padding and border — it won’t grow bigger.

Block Elements:
 Definition:
 Block elements take full width of the page (from left to right) and start on a new line.

 Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, <ul>, <li>, <section>

 Behavior:

Always starts on a new line
Can set width, height, margin, padding

2. Inline Elements:
 Definition:
Inline elements take only as much width as needed by the content and do not start on a new line.

 Examples: <span>, <a>, <strong>, <em>, <img>

 Behavior:

Does not break into a new line
Cannot set width or height

3. Inline-Block Elements:
 Definition:
Inline-block elements behave like inline (stay in the same line), but you can set width and height like block.

Examples: <button>, <input>, or any element styled as:
display: inline-block;
 Behavior:

Sits in line with other elements
You can set width, height, margin, and padding


CSS inheritance
Inheritance in CSS means some properties are automatically passed from parent to child elements.

It helps avoid repeating the same styles.
Example:

<div style="color: red;">
  <p>This is a paragraph.</p>
</div>

 The <p> inside <div> inherits the red color.
You don’t need to write color: red; for <p> again.

Common Inherited Properties:               
color
font-size
font-family
line-height
visibility

Not Inherited by Default:
margin
padding
border
width, height
background
