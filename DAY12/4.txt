  Mouse Events in JavaScript 
Mouse events are actions that happen when the user interacts with a mouse on a web page — like clicking, hovering, moving, etc.

| Event Name   | What It Means (Easy)                                   |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `click`      | When you click (press and release) the mouse           |
| `dblclick`   | When you double-click the mouse                        |
| `mousedown`  | When you press down the mouse button                   |
| `mouseup`    | When you release the mouse button                      |
| `mousemove`  | When you move the mouse over an element                |
| `mouseenter` | When the mouse enters (comes over) an element          |
| `mouseleave` | When the mouse leaves the element                      |
| `mouseover`  | Like `mouseenter` but also triggers for child elements |
| `mouseout`   | Like `mouseleave` but also triggers for child elements |

Key Events in JavaScript 
Key events happen when you press or release a key on your keyboard.
JavaScript can detect and respond to those actions — like when you type something.

| Event Name | What It Means (Easy)                                                     |
| ---------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `keydown`  | When you **press down** a key                                            |
| `keypress` | When you **press** a key that gives a character (older, now rarely used) |
| `keyup`    | When you **release** the key                                             |

window + Key Events in JavaScript
You can attach keyboard events to the whole window object, so it listens to key presses anywhere on the page, not just in a specific input box.

| Event          | What It Means (Easy)                   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `load`         | Page fully loaded (images, styles too) |
| `resize`       | When the browser window size changes   |
| `scroll`       | When you scroll the page               |
| `beforeunload` | When you’re about to leave the page    |
| `keydown`      | When any key is pressed                |

--->NOTE-->without eventlistener we use on before an event like onmouseover but when we use event listner we do not 
use on befor event only type mouseover


What is addEventListener?
It’s a way to tell JavaScript to do something when an event happens.

Like:

when you click a button
when you press a key
when the page loads

Simple Format:
element.addEventListener("eventName", functionToRun);

Why use addEventListener?
You can add multiple events to same element
Keeps JavaScript and HTML clean and separate
More flexible than using onclick or onkeydown directly


this in addEventListener :
In addEventListener, this means the element that triggered the event.


Example:
button.addEventListener("click", function() {
  this.style.color = "red";
});

Scroll Event 
The scroll event happens when you scroll up or down on a page or inside a scrollable element.

Use Cases:
Show "Back to Top" button
Make sticky headers
Load more data when user scrolls to bottom (like Instagram)
