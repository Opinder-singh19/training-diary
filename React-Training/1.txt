Debugging ‚Äì 
Debugging means finding and fixing errors (bugs) in your code so it works correctly.

 Example:
If your button doesn't work, debugging is like:

Checking the code 
Finding the typo or logic mistake 
Fixing it 
Testing again 

Node.js ‚Äì Easy Definition:
Node.js is a JavaScript runtime that lets you run JavaScript outside the browser ‚Äî like on your computer or server.

Simple Words:
JavaScript usually runs in browsers (like Chrome).
Node.js lets JavaScript run on your machine like Python or C programs.


What is package.json?
It‚Äôs a special file in every Node.js/React project that:

Stores project info (name, version, description).
Lists dependencies (what packages your project needs to work).
Defines scripts (shortcuts to run commands like npm start or npm run build).

| Feature                | `package.json`                                           | `package-lock.json`                                      |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| üìú **Purpose**         | Tells **what** packages your project needs               | Locks **exact versions** of those packages               |
| ‚úçÔ∏è **Who creates it?** | You or tools like `npm init`                             | Automatically created by `npm install`                   |
| üî¢ **Version control** | Uses version ranges (`^`, `~`, etc.)                     | Uses exact versions (`1.2.3`)                            |
| üß† **Editable?**       | Yes, you edit this file directly                         | No, you usually don‚Äôt touch it                           |
| üß± **Level**           | Top-level dependencies only                              | Includes nested (child) dependencies too                 |
| üéØ **Use case**        | For humans to understand and manage project dependencies | For npm to reproduce the **same environment** every time |
