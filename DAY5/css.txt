What is CSS?
CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets.
It is used to style HTML pages — basically, it makes your website look good!

 What Does CSS Do?
 Changes colors
 Changes fonts and text size 
 Controls layout, margins, spacing
 Makes websites responsive (look good on mobile)


 h1 {
  color: red;
}
This means:

Selector = h1 → (Heading)
Property = color → (What you want to change)
Value = red → (How you want it)

There are three types of css 
1) inline css 2) internal css  3)external css

--> inline css 
   CSS written directly inside an HTML tag.
    Used for small, quick changes.
    ❌ Not good for big projects.

--> internal css 
    CSS written inside a <style> tag in the same HTML file (in <head>).
    Good for styling a single page.

--> external css 
    CSS written in a separate file (like style.css), then linked to the HTML.
    Best for big websites.
    Easy to reuse and manage.

   | Selector Type      | Example    | What it does                           |
| ------------------ | ---------- | -------------------------------------- |
| **Universal**      | `* {}`     | Selects **all** elements               |
| **Tag**            | `p {}`     | Selects all `<p>` tags                 |
| **Class**          | `.name {}` | Selects elements with **class="name"** |
| **ID**             | `#main {}` | Selects element with **id="main"**     |
| **Group**          | `h1, p {}` | Styles **both h1 and p**               |
| **Inside Element** | `div p {}` | Styles `<p>` inside `<div>`            |
